# Teleport Scoreboard

This is a utility Minecraft data pack that adds the ability to teleport an entity to a location stored on the scoreboard. This data pack is not intended to be used alone and there's no way for a player without operator permissions to set the required scoreboard values or trigger the teleportation. 

Requires Minecraft 1.19.4 (Known to fail in 1.19.3 and below)
